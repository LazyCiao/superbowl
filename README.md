Admin Access:
To access the administrative features of the Bureau Web Application, you can use the existing superuser account. The credentials for the superuser account are as follows:

superuser:
Username: ciao
Password: test3275

staff/admin:
Username: admin
Password: test3275

base user:
Username: testuser
Password: test3275

Use these credentials to log in to the admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin and manage the application's data.
Please note that the existing superuser account already has administrative privileges, and you don't need to create a new superuser account unless necessary.

Remember to replace "your_existing_superuser_username" and "your_existing_superuser_password" with the actual username and password of your existing superuser account.

By providing the superuser credentials, other users can log in to the admin interface using the existing superuser account without the need to create a new one.
